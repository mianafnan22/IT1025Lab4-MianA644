## Executive Summary 
In this lab, I learned about the differences in svg and jpg and compression zip files. I also learned about the confidentiality of the CIA anf their purpose as well as the ICANN. This lab taught me how to encrypt in different Ciphertext.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption
### Information Systems Security
#### Security Triad
In the security triad, there are three components called Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA). The confidentiality controls who will see your chat and restrict or allows accesss to those who need to others. Integrity makes sure that you or someelse's information isn't manipulated and is only the truth. Availability means information can be accessed and modified by anyone authorized to do so in an appropriate timeframe in the amazon chat. 

#### Authentication
Something they know, something they have, or something they are. By combining two or more of these factors, it becomes much more difficult for someone to misrepresent themselves. It requires more than one way of authorizition and is unique in every each factor.
#### ACL and RBAC
An ACL identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific actions with an information resource such as data files. The drawbacks of ACL is that each information resource is managed separately so, as the number of users and resources increase, ACLs become harder to maintain. With RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access which allows the administrators to manage users and roles separately. This gives RBAC the upper hand. ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.

#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
In Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption. One key (public key) is used for encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.

#### Public Key Cryptography
Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys, and private keys. The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms which are based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions. 

### Cryptography
#### Encryption

we have to flank
#### Frequency Fingerprint
The vowel letters had the highest frequency
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. Ituses multiple shifts to tranmit the message.
#### Polyalphabetic Example
My messaage was meet "me at the pond". The shift word was at. Encrypted it was nyfn fn bn ubf jphe and decryptrd it was lkdz lk zz snd vntc. The letters shifted according to their numbers in at. 

#### Brute-Force
A brute-force attack tries every possible decryption key for a cipher. Ceasar Cipher is not that effective because you can guess one key, decrypting the ciphertext with that key, looking at the output, and then moving on to the next key if you didn’t find the secret message.

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
IP (Internet Protocol address) addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. The IPv4 is a finite space, and after years of rapid Internet expansion, its pool of available unallocated addresses has been fully allocated to Internet services providers (ISPs) and users. IPv6 was made to increase the number of IP addresses available. IPv6 was next generation of network-protocol and shut down important test networks because there was no need for them hence making IPv6 superior. 
#### ICANN
ICANN works to ensure the security, stability and interoperability of the Internet through creating fair policies and through operation of the domain name system. ICANN allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world.

### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
It is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware. It is responsible for connecting government computer systems to each other through a global, fault tolerant, network.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in. The Client needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established. 
#### Layers
#### Application Layer
It is because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. Layers are useful because they allow you to move and manipulate parts of an image to see how your changes affect the whole. SMTP, SNMP, FTP, HTTP, POP3 are the appilcations used in these layers.
## Internet Security
#### HTTP and Client-Server Model
Hypertest Transfer Protocol is a protocol used for viewing web pages online. The client request for the HTML pages towards server and the server responses with HTML pages. In this, the client requests pages and objects through its agent and Server responses them with the requested objects by displaying.
#### Protocols for Secure HTTP
HTTPS encrypts the data. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using what's known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure.
## Securing your Web Browser

#### Reasons to Secure Browser
Your web browser that comes with an operating system is not set up in a secure default configuration. Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.
#### Risk Explained
Rather than actively targeting and attacking vulnerable systems,a malicious website can passively compromise systems as the site is visited. Tt is because an attacker can create a malicious web page that will install Trojan software or spyware that will steal your information.

## Internet Programming
#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and Director. He created W3C to bring diverse stake-holders together, under a clear and effective consensus-based process. In web design and applications, accessibilty is a very important. The web has the power to change the way we communicate towards each other because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world but can also create barriers that exclude people from using the Web if not used correctly. Fully accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach. Examples of accessiblity would be speech input, colorblind, and audio that reads sentences out.
#### HTML5 and CSS
The purpose of HTML5 is to display the information and writing. CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation. 

#### HTML and XML
XML mainly focuses on transfer of data while HTML is focused on presentation of the data. XML is content driven whereas HTML is format driven. XML is Case sensitive while HTML is Case insensitive and ML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are.

## Components of a URL
Scheme = https, 
domain =  www.amazon.com, 
top level domain = .edu, 
default page = no file path provided, 
parameters = the result of search, 
Anchor = specific location on a page

## File compression
File compression means the total file size is smaller and takes less time to upload. Before compression the size was 448 KB and after compression it was 228 KB. SVG image quality remains same on zooming. SVG image is generally larger than JPG image of same image. JPG images are not editable.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, the new material that is crucial to learn because of it provides you with important content in IT. It teaches you different types of ,encrypted languages, and different types of images and their graphics as well as how to display them through python.
